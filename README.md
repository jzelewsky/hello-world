# hello-world
My hello-world repo for learning Git
I am new to git in the sense that I have never had a non-work account before. 
I want to learn how to code for Unity. The world of AR/VR is untapped and exciting. I feel that this is the next really big technology that will impact how we live our daily lives. I am very interested in developing it for healthcare. 

While I understand the theory of several languages like Java, Python, Cucumber and C#, I have never really learned how to code profeciently. It is my goal to become better than average at Unity this year.

Ultimately I want to work in AR/VR.
